## API Endpoints Implementation Status

### Router Operations
- [x] POST /api/router/test - Test router connection
- [x] POST /api/router/connect - Connect to a router
- [x] GET /api/routers - Get all connected routers
- [x] GET /api/router/:id - Get specific router info
- [x] DELETE /api/router/:id - Disconnect from router

### Hotspot User Management
- [x] GET /api/router/:id/hotspot/active - Get active users
- [x] GET /api/router/:id/hotspot/users - Get all hotspot users
- [x] POST /api/router/:id/hotspot/users - Create new user
- [x] DELETE /api/router/:id/hotspot/users/:userId - Delete user
- [x] POST /api/router/:id/hotspot/active/:userId/disconnect - Disconnect user

### Hotspot Profiles
- [x] GET /api/router/:id/hotspot/profiles - Get user profiles

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Router Detection & Connection
- Connect to multiple MikroTik routers simultaneously
- Auto-detect router identity, model, version
- Test connection before adding
- Store connections in-memory (no database)

### ✅ Real-time Monitoring
- CPU load percentage
- Memory usage (free/total)
- System uptime
- Active user count
- Router version and model info

### ✅ CRUD Operations
**Create:**
- Add new router connections
- Create hotspot users (vouchers)

**Read:**
- List all connected routers
- Get router statistics
- View active users
- View all hotspot users
- View available profiles

**Update:**
- Refresh router statistics (auto-refresh every 5 seconds)

**Delete:**
- Disconnect from router
- Delete hotspot users
- Kick active users

### ✅ User Interface
- Modern, responsive design using shadcn/ui
- Real-time data updates using React Query
- Beautiful cards showing router stats
- Progress bars for CPU and memory
- Status badges (Online/Offline)
- Toast notifications for actions
- Dialog forms for adding routers

## How to Run (Verified Working)

### Option 1: Run Everything Together
```bash
npm run dev:all
```
This starts:
- Frontend on http://localhost:5173
- Backend on http://localhost:3001

### Option 2: Run Separately

**Terminal 1 - Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Backend:**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

## What You Can Do Now

1. **Connect to Your Router:**
   - Navigate to /routers
   - Click "Add Router"
   - Enter your MikroTik credentials
   - See real-time stats

2. **Monitor Your Network:**
   - View CPU and memory usage
   - See active user count
   - Check router uptime

3. **Manage Users:**
   - Use the API to create vouchers
   - Delete users
   - Disconnect active sessions

4. **Integrate with Existing Pages:**
   - Update Dashboard to show real router data
   - Connect Vouchers page to create actual users on router
   - Update Users page to show real hotspot users

## MikroTik Router Requirements

Your MikroTik router must have:
- ✓ API service enabled (port 8728)
- ✓ User account with API access
- ✓ Network connectivity to the server

To enable API on your router:
```
/ip service
set api port=8728 disabled=no
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Current Setup is for Development**

For production deployment:
1. Use HTTPS for frontend
2. Use MikroTik API-SSL (port 8729)
3. Implement authentication/authorization
4. Use environment variables for configuration
5. Implement rate limiting
6. Add input validation and sanitization
7. Restrict CORS to specific origins

## Confirmed Working ✓

**Backend:** ✓ Running on port 3001
**Frontend:** ✓ Builds without errors
**Dependencies:** ✓ All installed correctly
**API Endpoints:** ✓ All implemented
**Router Connection:** ✓ Ready to connect
**CRUD Operations:** ✓ All implemented
**UI Components:** ✓ All created and styled

## Next Steps

Now that the infrastructure is in place, you can:

1. **Test with a real router** - Connect to your MikroTik router
2. **Integrate dashboard** - Show real data from connected routers
3. **Connect voucher system** - Generate vouchers that create users on router
4. **Add user management** - Full CRUD on the Users page
5. **Implement batch operations** - Create multiple vouchers at once
6. **Add monitoring charts** - Historical data for bandwidth, users, etc.
